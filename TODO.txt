Server Side (Map - one square)

1. Get onMessage 
	- position of each player
	- color of each player

2. ConcurrentHashMap for store all connected clients

3. Redraw of client side needs to be 40 fps~

4. Each onMessage from players need to be re send to all and redraw on the next frame update. 

5. In what format I want to send data to client
	- and how I want to read them

6. JSON from server to client

----------

When one player moves:
- send new position to server
- server needs to broadcast this message to all players as json with all players positions (even old once)
- after receive each client will redraw canvas with new positions of each player
